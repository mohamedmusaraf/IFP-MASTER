# IFP-Admin
Admin View for the Smart Waste Management System

## Things to Implement

1) bar graph for bin id vs frequency filled
2) bar graph for bin vs complaint -> X:axis - Bin id, Y:axis- attributes (yes or no) -> 1 graph/attribute
3) finding emptying time for every bin.
4) average time for emptying
5) pie chart on frequent complaints 
6) demand according to area


###### There are two dbs to connect with - Queries and bins
###### Need to think of using both!
###### I am only connecting one of now - Queries

> Not to mess with mongodb url and main implementation
